# Different-Projects-Related-to-Multimedia-Systems

A project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Multimedia Systems".

The application was implemented in Matlab. Implementation of the encoder/decoder of a video based on some parameters. In a 5s - 10s video, in which there is gentle object and camera motion, an object was selected and disappeared algorithmically, utilizing the motion compensation technique. That is, a new video was created and saved in which the selected object is not present.</br> </br>
